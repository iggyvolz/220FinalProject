# 230FinalProject
Final class project for IGME-230

# Overview and Goals
## Step 1: Define Your Content and Functional Requirements
> What are you going to make? Storyboard it, and think about what kind of functionality you'll need in order to implement it. 

I will be making a Javascript sheet music editor.  My first application will be a simple editor using SVG.js, which can create sheet music with only quarter notes (clicking at a position on the page will add a quarter note there).  The second application will include multiple types of notes (eighth notes, half notes, et cetera) which can be dragged- and dropped into the music editor, which will animate them when dragged and dropped.  The third application will include several instruments which can be "played" (clicked or touched) to add music to the sheet music.


## Step 2: Set Up Your GitHub Repo
> Create a repo for your project, which will include a README.md file describing what you're going to do. If it's a private repo, make sure you add me as a collaborator. If you're working with a partner, you should share a single repo.

If you're reading this, you've already found my repository :)

## Step 3: What JavaScript Will You Need to Implement Your Idea?
> What type of interaction do you need to implement? Which library or libraries will you need in order ot make it work? Look at the various libraries linked from the [project 4 resources page](https://github.com/LawleyFall2017/230-fall2017/blob/master/projects/project4-resources.md) for ideas.

I will be using SVG.js in order to create my project.  I feel this is a better alternative to Canvas because all music is line- and curve-based, and I also need to be able to move elements on the page so they cannot be drawn.

## Step 4: Complete Tutorials or Replicate Demos
> Play with the library or libraries that you think will work best for your project. 

## Step 5: This Week's Deliverable
> Post at least one example of a demo or completed tutorial to banjo for your exercise this week, no later than 11:59pm on Friday night. 

## Step 6: Finish Your Proposal
> Write up your content and technology plan in your README.md document. If you want your final project grade to replace the grade for projects 1 and 2, make sure you indicate that in your document. This is due by Sunday, 11/19, at 11:59pm.
