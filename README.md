# 230FinalProject
Final class project for IGME-230

# Overview and Goals
## Step 1: Define Your Content and Functional Requirements
> What are you going to make? Storyboard it, and think about what kind of functionality you'll need in order to implement it. 

## Step 2: Set Up Your GitHub Repo
> Create a repo for your project, which will include a README.md file describing what you're going to do. If it's a private repo, make sure you add me as a collaborator. If you're working with a partner, you should share a single repo. 

## Step 3: What JavaScript Will You Need to Implement Your Idea?
> What type of interaction do you need to implement? Which library or libraries will you need in order ot make it work? Look at the various libraries linked from the [project 4 resources page](https://github.com/LawleyFall2017/230-fall2017/blob/master/projects/project4-resources.md) for ideas. 

## Step 4: Complete Tutorials or Replicate Demos
> Play with the library or libraries that you think will work best for your project. 

## Step 5: This Week's Deliverable
> Post at least one example of a demo or completed tutorial to banjo for your exercise this week, no later than 11:59pm on Friday night. 

## Step 6: Finish Your Proposal
> Write up your content and technology plan in your README.md document. If you want your final project grade to replace the grade for projects 1 and 2, make sure you indicate that in your document. This is due by Sunday, 11/19, at 11:59pm.
